## Video game made in the Unity game engine in April and May 2016, in a team of 3. This is unfortunately not the final version, as that was lost over time, but this earlier version can still show the idea behind it. 

Done for the IT Creativity & Gamecelerator 3.0 contest organized by Ubisoft Bucharest. Our team won second place.

The FightProject folder contains the build as packaged by Unity, as an .exe file, and the Scripts folder contains a number of C# scripts, for attacking, movement, health monitoring and others.
